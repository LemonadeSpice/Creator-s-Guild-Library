NH here. This is a great method for how to texture nice runways, buildings, large terrain pieces etc.
The method allows us to take several tiling textures and blend them smoothly together.

This image shows a world I build using this texturing method. It was used for the landscape and runway materials.

One unity material you can use to layer blend is orel's shader:
https://shaders.orels.sh/
It's capable of using a single mask image to blend between 5 different materials.

But this is a technique that you can use many different shaders with. Or even make your own.

### Fundamental Concept:
The goal with layered texture blender is to mix together multiple tiling textures, within a single material. It's regularly used by many AAA games in order to have buildings with a high detail level but also the ability for the artist to paint onto the mesh (as opposed to tiling a single texture).

The reason we want to do this, is because compared to just assigning different textures to mesh parts we can use a texture to blend the edges between materials. It also might offer a performance boost because it's 1 material instead of however many. 

Here's an example image:

![[EdgeBlend.png|697]]

In this image the blend between each surface is handled by a texture. The grass, concrete, sand, asphalt.

### The Mask:

In this case, I'm using an image to blend the textures. We can do this because the image has 4 channels of information that can be separated. The red, green, blue and transparency.

But we can actually get 5 channels out of it because the absence of any data can also be considered a channel.

This is the mask debug view of this area:

This is a raw view of how the blending texture looks, in this case:
- Blue = sand
- Red = concrete
- Black = grass
- Green = Asphalt

This is the actual map that's used to blend the textures. I'm getting creative with my UV unwrapping by lining up each area with the corresponding blend I want to achieve.

If you're familiar with the technique, I'm using it in the same way as I would use [[Trim Sheets]].

Otherwise, you can just paint a texture however you see fit.
